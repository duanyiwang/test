PyTorch is an optimized tensor library for deep learning using GPUs and CPUs.

Features described in this documentation are classified by release status:

Stable: These features will be maintained long-term and there should generally be no major performance limitations or gaps in documentation. We also expect to maintain backwards compatibility (although breaking changes can happen and notice will be given one release ahead of time).

Beta: These features are tagged as Beta because the API may change based on user feedback, because the performance needs to improve, or because coverage across operators is not yet complete. For Beta features, we are committing to seeing the feature through to the Stable classification. We are not, however, committing to backwards compatibility.

Prototype: These features are typically not available as part of binary distributions like PyPI or Conda, except sometimes behind run-time flags, and are at an early stage for feedback and testing.
Select your preferences and run the install command. Stable represents the most currently tested and supported version of PyTorch. This should be suitable for many users. Preview is available if you want the latest, not fully tested and supported, builds that are generated nightly. Please ensure that you have met the prerequisites below (e.g., numpy), depending on your package manager. Anaconda is our recommended package manager since it installs all dependencies. You can also install previous versions of PyTorch. Note that LibTorch is only available for C++.
